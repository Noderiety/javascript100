# Task

Modify the recursive `repeat` function provided in the boilerplate, such that it does not block the event loop (i.e. Timers and IO handlers can fire).  This necessarily requires repeat to be asynchronous.

A timeout is queued to fire after 1 second, which will print the results of the test and exit the process. `repeat` should release control of the event loop such that the timeout fires before 1500 milliseconds elapse.

Try to perform as many operations as you can before the timeout fires!

## Conditions

* Do not use any for/while loops or Array#forEach.
* Do not create any unecessary functions e.g. helpers.

## Hints

* If your program takes a long time to run, something is probably wrong.
  Use Control - C to kill the node process.

## Boilerplate

```js
function repeat(operation, num) {
  // modify this so it can be interrupted
  if (num <= 0) return
  operation()
  return repeat(operation, --num)
}

module.exports = repeat
```
