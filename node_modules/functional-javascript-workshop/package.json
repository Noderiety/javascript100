Recommend to instead [reinstall node/npm so you don't need sudo](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814).\n\n## Usage Instructions\n\n#### 1. Selecting a problem to work on\n\nOnce the workshop is installed, run `functional-javascript-workshop` to print a menu\nwhere you can select a problem to work on.\n\n```\n$ functional-javascript-workshop\n```\n\nProblems are listed in rough order of difficulty. You are advised to complete them in order, as later problems\nwill build on skills developed by solving previous problems.\n\n#### 2. Writing your solution\n\nOnce you have selected a problem, the workshop will remember which problem you are working on. \nUsing your preferred editor, simply create a file to write your solution in. Most problems will\nsupply some boilerplate with which to get started. Copy this from the problem description to your\nsolution file.\n\n#### 3. Testing your solution\n\nUse the workshop's `run` command to point the workshop at your solution file. Your solution will loaded \nand passed the problem input. This usually won't perform any validation, it will only show the program output.\n\n```\n$ functional-javascript-workshop run mysolution.js\n```\n \n#### 4. Verifying your solution\n\nYour solution will be verified against the output of the 'official' solution. \nIf all of the output matches, then you have successfully solved the problem!\n\n```\n$ functional-javascript-workshop verify mysolution.js\n```\n\n## Stuck?\n\nFeedback and criticism is welcome, please log your troubles in [issues](https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop/issues). \n\nFull curriculum reviews [like this one](https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop/issues/7) are incredibly helpful. More feedback like this please!\n\nWe're looking for more practical problems, so if you come across a problem in your day-to-day work which was solved simply and elegantly with some functional JavaScript techniques, please help us create an exercise out of it.\n\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![screen shot 2013-09-27 at 5 18 45 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/43438/1225514/08c87a70-276a-11e3-8db7-485e3c760373.png)\n![screen shot 2013-09-23 at 9 13 02 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/43438/1191466/f289f38a-2451-11e3-9ba5-a3c224b5ca97.png)\n\n## Resources\n\n[A growing collection of quality functional javascript resources can be found in the wiki](https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop/wiki). \n\n\n## Thanks rvagg\n\nThis tutorial was built using rvagg's [workshopper](https://github.com/rvagg/workshopper) framework.\n\n## Summary\n\n```\n project  : functional-javascript\n repo age : 7 months\n active   : 50 days\n commits  : 152\n files    : 70\n authors  :\n    69\tTim                     45.4%\n    67\tTim Oxley               44.1%\n     3\tSequoia McDowell        2.0%\n     2\tZJ                      1.3%\n     1\tNaor Biton              0.7%\n     1\tPavel Kornilov          0.7%\n     1\tSteve Teo               0.7%\n     1\tWei Lu                  0.7%\n     1\tYoshua Wuyts            0.7%\n     1\tflakyfilibuster         0.7%\n     1\tArvid Andersson         0.7%\n     1\ttim walker              0.7%\n     1\tBrendon Murphy          0.7%\n     1\tLorcan Coyle            0.7%\n     1\tMatthew Hokanson        0.7%\n```\n\n## Licence\n\nMIT\n",
