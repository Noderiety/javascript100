# FOR LOOPS

For loops look like this:

```js
for (var i=0; i<=10; i++) {
  // log the numbers 0 through 10
  console.log(i)
}
```

The variable `i` is used to track how many times the loop has run.

The statement `i<=10;` indicates the limit of the loop. 
It will continue to loop if `i` is less than or equal to `10`.

The statement `i++` increases the variable `i` by 1 each loop.

## The challenge:

Create a file named for-loop.js.

In that file define a variable named `total` and make it equal the number `0`.

Define a second variable named `limit` and make it equal the number `10`.

Create a for loop. On each loop, add the number `i` to the `total` variable.

You can use a statement like this one:

```js
total += i;
```

After the for loop, use `console.log()` to print the `total` variable to the terminal.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

`javascripting verify for-loop.js`
