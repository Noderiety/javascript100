  "readme": "# Count Up to Version 6 of JavaScript!\n\n**An intro to some ES6 features via a set of self-guided workshops.**\n\n![A screenshot of the main Count to 6 menu](screenshot.png)\n\nCount-to-6 will run you through a series of exercises that introduce you to some of the simpler features of ECMAScript 6, the upcoming revision to the JavaScript language. It leverages the excellent [Traceur compiler](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/) to allow you to write code with ES6 syntax, today.\n\nOur coverage so far is pretty minor, but it's growing over time. Check out the issues list for upcoming plans.\n\n## How to Play\n\nFirst install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Make sure it's a recent version, in the 0.10 range.\n\nNow do:\n\n```\nnpm install -g count-to-6\n```\n\nAnd get started by typing `count-to-6`!\n",
