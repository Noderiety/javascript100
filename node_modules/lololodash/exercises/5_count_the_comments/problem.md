# Count the Comments #
All functions of **Lo-Dash** are very helpful, but now let me show you one
of my favorites: the `groupBy` function.
* * *
## Come In For a Huddle ##
```js
_.groupBy(collection, [callback=identity])
```
Creates an object composed of keys generated from the results of running
each element of a collection Object through `callback`. The corresponding
value of each key is an array of the elements for which the key was generated.

#### Example ####
```js
_.groupBy(
    [4.2, 6.1, 6.4],
    function(num)
    {
        return Math.floor(num);
    }
);

// { '4': [4.2], '6': [6.1, 6.4] }

// using the ".pluck" callback shorthand...
_.groupBy(
    [
        {name: 'mike', age: 23},
        {name: 'mike', age: 41},
        {name: 'tom',  age: 19}
    ],
    'name'
);

/*
{
    'mike': [
        {name: 'mike', age: 23},
        {name: 'mike', age: 41}
    ],
    'tom': [
        {name: 'tom', age: 19}
    ]
}
*/
```
Another helper function I use often is `size`.
```js
 _.size(collection)
 ```
`size` gets the size of `collection` by returning `array.length` for Arrays
and Array-like Objects or the number of owned enumerable properties for Objects.

#### Example ####
```js
_.size([1, 2]);
// 2

_.size({ 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3 });
// 3

_.size('pebbles');
// 7
```

## Your Mission ##
We have a array of comments from the website:
```js
[
    { username: "tim", comment: "you doing a great job!" },
    { username: "tim", comment: "when you have new workshoppers?" },
    { username: "cat_lover", comment: "wtf? where are all the cats gone?" },
    { username: "max", comment: "where have you been on friday? we missed you!" },
    { username: "max", comment: "Do don't answer anymore - why?" },
    { username: "cat_lover", comment: "MORE cats!!!" },
    { username: "max", comment: "i really love your site" }
]
```
I want to know how to post the most comments without repeating the same user,
so please write a function that:
1. Counts the comments by `username`.
2. Sorts the return array by the total comment count of each user.  

```js
[ { username: "foo",    comment_count: 9 },
  { username: "foobar", comment_count: 2 } ]
```

#### Template ####
All of your solutions should follow this template:
```js
// include the Lo-Dash library
var _ = require("lodash");

var worker = function(/* arguments */) {
    // do work; return stuff
};

// export the worker function as a nodejs module
module.exports = worker;
```
**lololodash** will call your function and test it with different arguments.
